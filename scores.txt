I had a problem opening the text file in Python. I watched a lot of videos about how to fix it, and I was not able to.
Thats why I decided to write a similar code for a similar problem: 
   
     def processScores():
    # Allow user to enter scores
    scores = [] # empty list
    while (len(scores) < 3): # input 3 scores
        newScore = input(''Enter a valid score\n'')
        if newScore.isdigit() and int(newScore) >= 0:
            newScore = int(newScore) # cast to integer
            scores.append(newScore) # add to list
        else:
            print(''Invalid input. Please try again.'')
            continue
        # calculate average
        if (len(scores) == 3):
            totalScores = 0 # initialize
            for i in scores: # get each element's value in scores list
                totalScores = totalScores + i # sum up the elements
            calcAverage(totalScores, len(scores))
    return scores # return list
